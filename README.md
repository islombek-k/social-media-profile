# Social media project

### In this project, these tech stack is used:

- `React`, `Typescript`, `Vite`.
- **Additionally**: `Tailwind`, `React-Query`, `React-Hook-Form`, `MSWJS` for API mocking and also `react-hot-toast`.

**You can also watch deployed version at:** https://social-media-profile-beta.vercel.app/

And the project took me around 8+- hours to finish.
